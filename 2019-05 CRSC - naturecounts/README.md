### Title

`naturecounts`: a new R package to access standardized data on bird populations

### Abstract

NatureCounts is an online repository of plant and animal population data managed by Bird Studies Canada. It has over 128 million records from nearly 400 different sources generated by volunteer surveys and research projects across Canada. Recently we have developed an open-source R software package, `naturecounts`, to facilitate access to the NatureCounts repository via a new public API. This supports Bird Studies Canada's goal of providing data access for research, conservation, and education.
