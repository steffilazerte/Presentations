### Title

`cavityuse`: An R Package for Detecting Cavity Use From Geolocator Data

### Abstract

Many animals use cavities, caves or burrows as shelter and/or nesting sites. Use of these areas can be monitored to investigate patterns of parental behaviour, behavioural rhythms, roosting behaviour, and the use of shelter in and out of the breeding season. However, cavity use can be hard to monitor, as it generally requires significant human resources (e.g., through observation or video surveillance) and/or knowing where potential cavities are (e.g., to set up radio frequency identification [RFID] antennas or other monitoring equipment). Light-level geolocators are small, data-logging, photosensors usually mounted on the backs or legs of small animals. They record light levels at timed intervals, which are traditionally used to determine an animalâ€™s geographical location. However, this light data can also be used to detect cavity use by matching patterns of abrupt changes between light and dark and detecting gradual changes associated with sunrise and sunset. Here, we present a free and open-source R software package, `cavityuse`, designed to automate and simplify this process. We demonstrate the utility of this software by comparing cavity use by northern flickers (Colaptes auratus) scored by hand to that scored by the R package.
