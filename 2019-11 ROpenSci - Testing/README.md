### Title

ROpenSci Community Call: Last Night, Testing Saved my Life  
Experiences of a biologist

### Abstract

As someone with a background in science, not software engineering, Steffi LaZerte will share her experiences using automated testing in R to ensure that packages do what they're supposed to do, on all the operating systems they're supposed to do it on, and that they handle weird stuff gracefully.
