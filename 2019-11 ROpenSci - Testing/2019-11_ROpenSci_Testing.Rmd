My experiences: I.e. Not a computer programmer! Learned a bit piecemeal, this always learning new things, definitely not an expert.

# Different Kinds of Testing

 (According to Steffi)

## Due Diligence (Data-testing)
- Double checking output as part of an analysis
- Sometimes interactive only
- Sometimes Rmd Report for posterity (and reproducibility)

--

## Automated Package Tests
- Rigorous, repeated, and automatic tests of package functionality
- Often local **and** remote (i.e. CRAN, Travis Ci, AppVeyor, [R-hub](https://builder.r-hub.io/))

# Why I Started Testing

## Post-Doc on RFID project
- Summarize RFID data 
  - Movement between feeders
  - Time spent at a feeder
  - etc.
- Started with small scripts
- Created my first package ([`feedr`](https://github.com/animalnexus/feedr)!)

## But!
- My colleagues trusted me too much
- Package was getting big and worrisome
  - Mistakes
  - Breaking old code as adding new code

About 4 years ago got a post-doc to

- Hadley's "R packages" book chapter on Testing*
- Used [`testthat`](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat) package
- Series of test files (e.g., `test_utils.R`) in `tests/testthat` folder

> A reward you get that has no value beyond the fact that it's a reward!
]

???
I recently learned what a meritget is from Charles Gray on twitter. And although I'm still a bit hazy, I'm pretty sure it is a reward you get, that has no value, beyond the fact that it's a reward and therefore makes you feel better. I think it comes from the achievements you can unlock in most video games these days.

# Why I Keep Testing

## Problem solving
- Took over development of a package
  - No tests to start, but really helpful to add tests as I made changes
- Bug fixing
  - Writing tests to check that bug fixes worked

--

## Organization
- I use `testthat` tests even for long-running local tests that don't run remotely
  - Keeps me organized
- Test systematically for weird/unexpected input 
  - Make sure messages/warnings/errors show up where they should

???
Sometimes the logic of a function gets a bit complex, so it can be useful 
to have simple tests to make sure different situations are clearly dealt with

## Remote Testing
- Testing packages on other operating systems
  - Travis Ci, AppVeyor, [R-hub](https://builder.r-hub.io/)

# Why I Keep Testing

## Remote Testing
- Testing packages on other operating systems
  - Travis Ci, AppVeyor, [R-hub](https://builder.r-hub.io/)
- Using CRON scheduling on Travis Ci to check on and catch changing data sources  
  - e.g., run tests every couple of weeks for [`weathercan`](https://github.com/ropensci/weathercan)

# Problems with Testing

## Testing tests??!?!!
- Trouble shooting tests can take time
- Sometimes need to create special (small) datasets for testing (speed up testing)
- Sometimes complex operations take time to figure out how to test

# Problems with Testing

## Where it's hard to use it
- Difficult with shiny apps
  - But see: [`shinytest`](https://github.com/rstudio/shinytest), [`RSelenium`](https://github.com/ropensci/RSelenium)
- Difficult where credentials are needed
  - There are ways of adding credentials to online test suites
  - Create sample accounts with open credentials
  - Test secured credentials locally

# Final Tips

- Time consuming, but worth it!
- Start slowly
- Use a coverage metric (e.g., [codecov.io](http://codecov.io))
- Also test for wonky input
- Number test files so they run in order  
  - e.g., `test_01_base.R`, `test_02_main.R`
- Checkout the resources in this Community Call
