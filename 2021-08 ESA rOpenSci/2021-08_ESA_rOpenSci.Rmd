- Large, global datasets can be unweildly, so
- Lowering barriers is important because we can have all the open data in the world, but
if scientists can't access them, it's moot

- I'm going to highlight some rOpenSci packages which can be used to access large, global datasets for ecological research in different situations

???
- This tweet was inspired by a rOpenSci blog post asking how scientists use open data in their work.  
- What you can see here is an example of using open data to complement ecological field work.   
- This works particularly well in ecology with data related to weather, soil and other large-scale landscape metrics.
- Specially in this example, Ethan's lab is using data from NASA and NOAA

- and so it's great that rOpenSci has packages which can be used to access these kinds of data
- Large global datasets

During this pandemic, field work is often not an option, but with rOpenSci packages research can continue as scientists take advantage of the massive amounts of open scientific data that are freely available.

- Pandemic resulted in declines in human activity
- How does this affect use of urban areas by birds?
- Open data from eBird
- rOpenSci **auk** package to manage huge eBird data sets
