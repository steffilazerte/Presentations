### Title

R for Ornithologists: How R can benefit the study of Ornithology

### Abstract

Ornithologists “in the era of new technologies” have access to ever increasing sources of data, which in turn leads to large quantities of data. This wealth of data is exciting, but sometimes overwhelming, and with new technologies for collecting data, we need new technologies for processing and analyzing data. One such technology is the free and open source programming language, R. R is a powerful (and economical) tool that is highly extensible through ‘packages’ for performing specific tasks. Because there are so many packages, many ornithologists are not aware of the many ways in which R can be useful, or which packages are available for purposes beyond statistical analysis. However, there are numerous packages which have been developed for specific scientific, or even ornithological applications. Such examples include those for accessing relevant online data sources (e.g., climate data, eBird, population data, etc.), genomic analyses, bioacoustic analyses, analyses of animal movements, reproducible research workflow, and dissemination (e.g., graphs, maps, and interactive visualizations). This presentation will introduce ornithologists to these tools which make ornithological research quicker, easier, more affordable, and stronger.
