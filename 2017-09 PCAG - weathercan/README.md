### Title

weathercan: An R package to access historical weather data from Environment and Climate Change Canada

### Abstract (max 150 words)

Environment and Climate Change Canada maintains an online source of historical Canadian weather data. This data is freely accessible, but can require time and effort to download from multiple stations and across larger date ranges. It also requires considerable of processing before it can be used for further analysis. `weathercan` is an R package that simplifies this process. Historical weather data can be simultaneously downloaded from multiple stations and over large date ranges and automatically processed into a single dataset. Tools are also provided to identify stations either by name or proximity to a location, and to easily interpolate weather data for integrating this data into other datasets.

**Keywords (max 3):** tools, meteorology, R packages
