### Title

weathercan: An R package to access historical weather data from Environment and Climate Change Canada

### Abstract (max 150 words)

Environment and Climate Change Canada hosts decades of historical weather data online. This data is freely accessible, but can require time and effort to download data from multiple stations and across larger date ranges. It also requires a certain degree of processing before it can be used for analysis in software, such as R. `weathercan` is an R package designed for downloading historical weather data from the Environment and Climate Change Canada website. Data can be simultaneously dowloaded from multiple stations and over large date ranges and automatically processed into a single dataset. Tools are also provided to identify stations either by name or proximity to a location, and to easily interpolate weather data for integrating this data into other datasets.
